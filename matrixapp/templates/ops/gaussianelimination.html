    <h1>Gaussian Elimination: Find the solution for a given b</h1>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <p>The purpose of Gaussian Elimination is to create a reduced-row echelon form (notated RREF in most calculators). 
        In this application, as you will see, it is not only used to find the solution x for a given b, but also to find
        the inverse and the determinant.
